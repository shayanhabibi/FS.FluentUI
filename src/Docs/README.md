# DOCGEN

Using [Feliz.DaisyUI](https://github.com/dzoukr/Feliz.DaisyUI) and [a Feliz pull request](https://github.com/Freymaurer/Feliz/blob/master/docs/App.fs) docs for reference ontop of my own preferences and understanding.

Idea is to have pages written in markdown, and then reference components to insert into the renders where appropriate. This way we can have docs written in markdown rather than having to mess with Html.
